# Beach_Classification
Beach classification using water quality features.
Using the dataset(https://data.world/cityofchicago/beach-water-quality-automated-sensors), I've implemented a dense neural network using PyTorch to determine the name of the beach using its water features.
The project contains the data cleaning process, data normalization, and the training process of 3 different models.
